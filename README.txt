Thank you for viewing the TuneApp README.txt

This project uses a Maven to track its dependancies and run builds. To run a build, please run the pom.xml file as a Maven build. 

To run the JUnit tests, you can either run the maven build (this will run the full test package), or select a specific test class or method.

The TuneApp project runs as a java application from the JsonToCSV Class. The input and output files need to be passed in as arguments.
